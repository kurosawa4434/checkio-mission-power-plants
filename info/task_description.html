<p>
    This mission is another version of the
    <a href="https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/power-supply/">”Power Supply”</a> mission 
    originated from <a href="https://py.checkio.org/user/oduvan/">oduvan</a>'s idea.<br>
    You have to properly place the given power plants and supply power to all the cities.
</p>

<p>
The intercity network and the range of each power plant are given as input values.
A power plant can provide power to the city where it’s been placed and within its range.
You have to return a dictionary, where the key is the city in which you’ll place the power plant and the value is its range.

<!-- Do NOT change the indentation of this pre-block -->
<pre class="brush: python">power_plants({('A', 'B'), ('B', 'C'), ('C', 'D'), ('D', 'E')}, [2]) == {'C': 2}

    <strong>Input: </strong>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>The intercity network represented as a set of connections, where each connection is a tuple of two nodes connected with each other.</li>
        <li>The range of each power plant, represented as a list of integers.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong>
    <ul>
    <li>A dictionary of placements, where each key is the city in which you’ll place the power plant and each value is the corresponding range.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong>
    <ul>
    <li>3 &le; number of cities &le; 50</li>
    <li>1 &le; number of power-plants</li>
    <li>range of power-plant &ge; 0</li>
    <li>You will always be given enough or more power-plants.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
